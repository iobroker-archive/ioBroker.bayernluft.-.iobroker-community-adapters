## BayernLuft Adapter for ioBroker
Connects BayernLuft into IoBroker

## What needs to be done?
To use this adapter, you need to change the export template of the device
**Be sure to follow the steps below**

## How to change the Template?
1. Go to the Web-Interface of your Device
2. Click on the Settings Gear to head to the Settings
3. Scroll Down until you see the Expert Mode
4. Upload the file 'export_iobroker.txt' from this github repository.
8. Your Done, setup the device in the adapter instance. The standard port of the device is 80.

## Nice to Know
The commands commands.setSpeedIn, commands.setSpeedOut, commands.setSpeedAntiFreeze only work when the device is powered off. If the device is turned on, the commands are acknowledged by the device but nothing will happen (you can check manually in the corresponding states states.speed_in, states.speed_out and states.speed_antifreeze)

## Credits
This adapter would not have been possible without the great work of @Marco15453 (https://github.com/Marco15453), who create V1.x.x of this adapter.
Also a big thanks to the company Bayernluft for their great support
